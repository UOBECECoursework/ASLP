Decompress to any directory, [htk source code directory]

If you find this instruction confusing, check README for details.

HTK 3.5 comes with three sets of Makefiles enabling compilation for:

1. CPU (standard)
2. CPU using MKL (Intel Math Kernel library)
3. NVIDIA GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) using the NVIDIA CUDA compiler NVCC

Standard CPU installation is recommended.

0. Open terminal, check if gcc is installed. Type in:
   gcc --version
   If you get some version information, then follow the rest of this instruction. If not, install gcc first.

To install HTK tools:
1. Go to HTKLib source code directory:
   cd [htk source code directory]/HTKLib

2. Compile HTK libs:
   make -f MakefileCPU all -j4
  
3. Go to HTKTools source code directory:
   cd ../HTKTools
   
3. Install HTK tools:
   make -f MakefileCPU install -j4
   
Now there will be some executables under [htk source code directory]/bin.cpu
"HCompV", "HList" etc.

To install HLM tools:
1. Go to HLMLib source code directory:
   cd [htk source code directory]/HLMLib

2. Compile HLM libs:
   make -f MakefileCPU all -j4
  
3. Go to HLMTools source code directory:
   cd ../HLMTools
   
3. Install HLM tools:
   make -f MakefileCPU install -j4
   
 Now you will see some new executables under [htk source code directory]/bin.cpu
 "Cluster", "LMerge" etc.
 
 The usage of these executables are exactly the same as those ".exe" executables we used in Lab2.
